# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency created in 2009 that uses peer-to-peer technology to facilitate instant payments.

In this project, we will attempt to predict the prices of Bitcoin using linear regression. The training dataset for the project was collected from (URL). The data contains Bitcoin prices from April of 2013 to July of 2017.

## Summary and Future Outlook
For my future analysis, I would like to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model to predict the prices of Bitcoin. LSTM cells can learn the iomportant parts of the sequence seen so far in the historicala data of Bitcoin and forget the less important ones.
